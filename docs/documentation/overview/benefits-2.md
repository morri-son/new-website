The Open Component Model (OCM) is an open-source toolset for **secure software supply chain** management.

- OCM gives you full visibility and control across the supply chain, streamlining compliance checks, security scans, and deployments.
- OCM works everywhere — cloud, on-premises, hybrid, and air-gapped environments.
- OCM integrates seamlessly with your existing tools and is easy to extend.

With OCM, you gain control, reduce risk, and keep your delivery approach adaptable.

## Why Choose OCM

### Complete Software Bill of Delivery

With OCM, you can describe everything you deliver in a unified, machine-readable format. This enables you to create a **Software Bill of Delivery (SBoD)**. Unlike a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), which lists all components inside an application, a **Software Bill of Delivery** focuses on **everything you need for a successful deployment** — including container images, Helm charts, configuration files, and binaries. 

It is a complete, verifiable record of all deliverables and how to access them. This unified approach eliminates the confusion of managing multiple artifact types across different systems and provides **complete transparency** over all dependencies and deployment artifacts in a single, standardized format.

### Cryptographic Security & Provenance

Security is built into OCM for your **secure software supply chain**. You can **cryptographically sign and verify** every component in your supply chain to ensure its integrity and confirm its provenance. This protection extends from the initial build through every stage of your delivery pipeline.

Beyond signatures, OCM uses [**immutable, globally unique component identities**](/documentation/concepts/coordinates). These act like tracking IDs, linking all lifecycle phases and making compliance checks, audits, and vulnerability scans easier and more reliable. With OCM, your software is **fully traceable from build to deployment**, providing an unbroken chain of custody that security teams and auditors require.

### Deploy Anywhere, Even Air-Gapped

OCM enables **universal delivery** — you can **deploy anywhere: public cloud, on-premises, hybrid, or air-gapped environments**. OCM separates the identity of software artifacts from their location, allowing identities to remain stable while locations can change as needed.

This flexibility means you can store software artifacts in local registries, move them between systems, and work in environments with **limited or no internet access** — all without losing integrity or traceability. Whether you're deploying to a cloud environment or transferring software to isolated networks, OCM maintains complete consistency and security.

### Works with Your Existing Stack

OCM **works with your current tools** and integrates seamlessly across different technology generations. It is compatible with **cloud-native technologies**, **modern development environments**, and **legacy systems**. You can manage both new and existing software without rewriting existing tools or processes.

The **technology-neutral design** means OCM adapts to your infrastructure rather than forcing you to adapt to it. Whether you're working with containers, traditional applications, or emerging technologies, OCM provides a consistent interface for managing your entire software portfolio.

### Open Source & Future-Proof

OCM is **committed to open source** and **welcomes contributions of any kind**. We work to keep OCM aligned with the changing needs of the community, ensuring that the toolset evolves with real-world requirements rather than vendor-driven priorities.

The **extensible design** of OCM makes it easy to adapt to emerging technologies, keeping your software supply chain future-proof. Anyone can suggest, review, and merge improvements in a transparent way, creating a toolset that grows stronger with community input and remains relevant as technology landscapes evolve.

### Compliance & Audit Ready

OCM makes **compliance checks and audits significantly easier** through its immutable, globally unique identities that function as tracking IDs across all lifecycle phases. This enables **reliable vulnerability scans** and **verifiable compliance reports** that auditors can trust.

With OCM, you have a complete, verifiable record of all deliverables from build to deployment — perfect for regulated industries and security audits. The cryptographic signatures and immutable identities provide the evidence trail that compliance frameworks require, while automated tracking reduces the manual effort typically needed for audit preparation.

## Who is OCM for

OCM is designed for organizations that need to:

- **Maintain security and compliance** across complex software supply chains
- **Deploy software reliably** across diverse environments including air-gapped systems  
- **Manage both modern and legacy applications** with a unified approach
- **Ensure traceability and provenance** for all software deliverables
- **Reduce risk** while maintaining development velocity

Whether you're a security team ensuring supply chain integrity, a DevOps team managing multi-environment deployments, or a compliance officer preparing for audits, OCM provides the tools and transparency you need to succeed.
